The code contains bugs and so does not give accurate analyses of the data. Unfortunately, your colleague is on a business trip and you have been asked to debug some functions in the code. The company plans to use your revised code to improve the accuracy of sales analytics.\n","\n","Your task is to identify potential edge cases in the functions and the underlying data that might result in logic and runtime errors, such as missing values, incorrect data types, or incompatible values (e.g., negatives). Enhance the custom functions provided by implementing exceptions to catch data quality issues and edge cases.\n","\n","Your company has provided you with a csv file called \"sales_data_sample.csv\" for the analyses.
