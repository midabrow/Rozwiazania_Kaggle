    "Jump into the buzzing world of Twitter! üê¶ In this project, you'll explore the fascinating network of Twitter connections and uncover the hidden patterns within one of the most popular social networks out there. You'll get hands-on with real Twitter follower data using Pandas, transforming it into a cool directed graph with NetworkX. Along the way, you'll learn how to spot key influencers, find out who follows who, and discover mutual connections between users.\n",
