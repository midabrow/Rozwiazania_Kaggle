You work for a new startup company that has just launched a new online shopping website.

Specifically, the team wants you to generate some insights into customer browsing behaviors in November and December, the busiest months for shoppers. You have decided to identify two groups of customers: those with a low purchase rate and returning customers. After identifying these groups, you want to determine the probability that any of these customers will make a purchase in a new marketing campaign to help gauge potential success for next year's sales.\n","\n","### Data description:\n","\n","You are given an `online_shopping_session_data.csv` that contains several columns about each shopping session.
