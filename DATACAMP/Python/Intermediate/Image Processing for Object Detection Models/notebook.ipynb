The footage needs to be examined to find out when animals have been captured in the footage. Classifying all captured images based on whether the feature animals could save weeks of work. \n","\n","You are part of a data science team involved in making this documentary, and your task is to prepare an image processing pipeline. The pipeline will augment existing datasets of images featuring animals so that an object-detection model can be trained and used on the footage.\n","\n","Data augmentation involves creating variations of the original images through transformations like rotation, scaling, and equalizing to increase the training dataset's diversity and models' robustness. This technique enriches the dataset without collecting more data, helping models generalize better to new, unseen images.\n","\n","In this project, you will perform image processing operations on five images featuring animals. The output of this project will be a pipeline transforming images to produce augmented datasets.\n","\n","## Data\n","\n","The `COCO` (Common Objects in Context) dataset is a dataset designed for training and evaluating computer vision models on a variety of tasks, including object detection. Five images featuring animals have been downloaded from this dataset. \n","\n","The list `file_names` is already available and contains the names of the image files available in the current directory."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"29b288e3","metadata":{},"source":["Help the team process their dataset of animal images in preparation for modeling.\n","\n","- Write a function called image_processing capable of importing and transforming multiple images, and outputting a transformed dataset of images in the form of a list. It should import images and resize, rotate, and equalize them (i.e. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) in that order. The function will have the following parameters:\n","\n","  - file_names: Accepts a list of strings, each a path to an image. No default value.\n","\n","  - size: Accepts a tuple for the target resize shape, defaulting to (250,250).\n","\n","  - rotation_angle: Accepts a numeric input for rotation degree, defaulting to 0.\n","\n","  - equalization_clip_limit: Accept a number (0-1) for the equalization clip limit, default to None.
